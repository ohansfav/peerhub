# Peerhub Server

## Project Overview

**Peerhub** is a proprietary peer-powered ed-tech platform designed to democratize access to quality education for Nigerian secondary school students. By connecting learners with vetted university undergraduates and recent graduates, Peerhub enables personalized, live one-on-one tutoring sessions focused on exam preparation for WAEC, NECO, and JAMB.

This repository contains the **server-side API** powering Peerhub. The frontend (client) and backend (server) are maintained as separate codebases.
